# TSP

- I implemented two representations of graph: adjacency matrix and adjacency list
- I implemented Graph serialization and deserialization
- I implemented TSP solver for directed graph and undirected graph using Brute force(14 vertices) and Dynamic Programming(23 vertices ) methods 
- I benchmarked their performance respectively with regression testing
